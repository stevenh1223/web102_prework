## Notes

The most difficult challenge for me is the third one since I only use the backtick function occasionally, and the template literals require every single letter to be right precisely, with no adjustment made by the IDE. Also, I am fortunate enough to find out that the "scroll-behavior: smooth;" CSS code can make the scrolling of the nav bar smoother.
